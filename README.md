# house-party

## What is house party?
House party is a music controller for all your parties!
- Host your own room using your Spotify account and make your friends join it. 
- You can set rules for your room i.e what guests have control for and how many votes they need to skip the current song!
- Guests can skip the song with `x` number of votes or can play or pause the current song.

## What are the technologies used?
- React for the frontend
- Django for the backend 
- SQLite for the DB (until I figure a way to deploy)
- DRF for the API

## Future?
- Deploy
- Clean the code.
